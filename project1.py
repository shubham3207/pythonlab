#write a program that that reads the base and the height of a right-angled triangle and prints the area.
#every number is given on a seperate line
base=int(input(" enter the base"))
height=int(input("enter the height"))
area=(base*height)//2
#the floor division // rounds the result down to the nearest whole number
print(f"the area of right angled triangle is {area}")
